More information regarding installing the application are provided in the README of the github repository.

The GitHub repository is available at: <Link to be put here>

Clone the repository to a local file using standard git clone command.
After this open the directory in command prompt and type npm install.
The npm install will take some time as there are several dependencies our application uses (and by nature of the node_modules folder)

Type npm start to run the application. Again, this takes some time. Once this is done type localhost:3000 in a browser (it might open on its own)
The application should be running.

Our application is intended to be used on mobile phones but using it on desktop is not an issue.

If mobile display is to be used, run this application using mobile display for iPhone 6/7/8 ideally.
Alternatively Pixel 2 is good too.
The mobile type can be set in chrome developer tools using the mobile phone icon to the left of the elements tab.

If there are missing dependencies then it is likely to be the moment npm package.
To resolve this type npm install moment.
