## WeatherLiving

A simple weather application which shows the current weather. Users can enter if they would prefer similar, warmer or colder weather, alongside a distance. Once this is done it will take users to another page to show them a list of holiday destinations which meet the criteria.

## Installation instructions

Clone this repository as per usual, using `git clone <repository link>`. After this open the directory in a command line. Use npm install to get all dependencies. This will take some time.

## Additional notes

Please note that results take some time to load after searching for locations. Please allow a second or two for results to show up, possibly longer especially if the range was set very high. After a while, however, you can safely assume that there were no results found.

Any inaccuracies in the temperature and weather name can be put down to the weather API.
